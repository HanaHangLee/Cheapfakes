# Out-of-Context Multi-Modal CheapFakes Detection

This study utilizes scene graphs and existing research in image-text matching to enable the model to identify inconsistencies based on similarity scores of image-caption pairs.

Additionally, it extracts features that represent the correlation between captions.

These features are then integrated using a Transformer encoder with an attention mechanism to enhance multi-modal representation learning.
